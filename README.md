# password-stats

Statistics of Password Databases in Julia:

Doing a course about Network Security the question came up,
which symbols are most frequent on which positions in a password.

Doing a search on Github provided several leaked password files:

This repo contains two Jupyter Notebooks with statistic calculations regarding the question.
The password files are not uploaded here again, however the used files are printed in the Jupyter Notebooks for reference.
